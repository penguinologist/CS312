#Quizgame - the app!

*** Before you pull out your iPhone thinking oooh yay, an app!!! woohoo!!! STOP. This is an Android app. ***
Sorry Apple fanboys/girls, Android is just easier to develop on



This was an assignment for CS 321, Software Engineering and Requirements something something. Essentially what they did was give us some semi-functional code, and then told us to improve upon it. My team and I (although coding-wise primarily myself), then proceeded to turn this hunk of junk into a fully functional Android app. This will be the first app I release publicly on the playstore, and a link to it shall be provided as soon as it gets verified.

Issues we ran into:
- reading and writing to and from files -> solved by just using a Parse database
- horrible spaghetti code without any documentation ->solved by completely rewriting the code from scratch, keeping only the essence intact
- not having an android to develop on and having to use a virtual machine for 3 weeks -> fixed by obtaining an android device.
- rotation issues -> just added some more enhancements to the AndroidManifest.xml settings.
